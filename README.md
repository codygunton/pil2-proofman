## ⚠️ Disclaimer: Software Under Development ⚠️

This software is currently under **active development** and has not been audited for security or correctness.

Please be aware of the following:
* The software is **not fully tested**.
* **Do not use it in production environments** until a stable production release is available. 🚧
* Additional functionalities and optimizations **are planned for future releases**.
* Future updates may introduce breaking **backward compatible changes** as development progresses.

# Proofs Manager

The Proof Manager is an adaptable Proof Manager designed to assist in the creation of proofs from a PIL2 pilout-formatted file. It is designed to be used in conjunction with the [PIL2](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/pilcom) compiler and proofman-js [pil2-proofman-js](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez/pil2-proofman-js) to generate the setup.

# Python Spec

An executable specification of the FRI PCS in `executable-spec/`.

# Pinning Tests

Golden file tests that validate the Rust/C++ prover produces deterministic output.

```bash
cargo test -p pinning              # all pinning tests
cargo test -p pinning pinning      # proof file checksums
cargo test -p pinning fri          # FRI output values
cargo test -p pinning simple       # simple AIR only
cargo test -p pinning lookup       # lookup AIR only
```

Prerequisites: `./setup.sh`

Regenerate FRI golden values: `./generate-fri-vectors.sh`
